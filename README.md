# FS Fourier Series
Fourier series decomposition

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series):

> In mathematics, a **Fourier series** decomposes periodic functions or
> periodic signals into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple
> oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines (or complex exponentials).

Use the bottom right form to change the visualized serie.
